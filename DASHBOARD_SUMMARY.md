## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `public/dashboard.html` - Main dashboard page (500+ lines)
2. `public/js/dashboard.js` - Dashboard logic (600+ lines)
3. `DASHBOARD.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Chat System
- **Quick Link**: Navigate to chat rooms from dashboard
- **User Authentication**: Shared username and avatar
- **Superuser Detection**: Admin access from both places

### With Auth0
- **Auto-Redirect**: Logged-in users go to dashboard
- **Profile Data**: Avatar and name pre-filled
- **Session Management**: Logout clears both systems

### With Database (Future)
Currently posts are in-memory. To persist:
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  author VARCHAR(255),
  content TEXT,
  category VARCHAR(50),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  likes INT DEFAULT 0
);
```
